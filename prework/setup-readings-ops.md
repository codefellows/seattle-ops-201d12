# Create a Reading Notes Repo

If you don't already have one, create a `reading-notes` repository on GitHub, where you can keep track of your observations and questions from the reading assignments throughout your course.

Think of it as a way to document and highlight your new knowledge. Publish it with GitHub pages, so it becomes a live web site.

## Setup and Documentation

Use these resources to get going:

- [Markdown on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax){:target="_blank"}

- ## Requirements

1. If you have previously created this repo for another class, double-check to ensure it follows all guidelines here.
1. On the README.md page:
   - Include a level-1 heading titled `Reading Notes`
   - Include a description of what this repo is about
   - Include a level-2 heading for each course, ie:
     - `Ops 102: Intro to Computer Operations`
     - `Ops 201: Foundations of Computer Operations`
     - `Ops 301: Networking and Systems Administration`
     - `Ops 401: Cybersecurity Engineering`
1. For each new reading file:
   - Title each new file with the course-code and the assignment number (ie: 'ops-201d14-reading-06.md')
   - Include links to each reading notes files under the appropriate heading on the README.md page
