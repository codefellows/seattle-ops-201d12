# Feedback Week 2

## The Good
- I love everything honestly. I have no issues. I just wish we had more time to absorb everything.
- TA assistance (4)
- demo explanation
- I actually enjoyed the group exercise. It was good to hear how other students are thinking and how they attack the labs.
- I am navigating a lot easier in the computer and it makes me feel more confident.
- The recording of the videos is the most helpful
- Course Correction
- Classmates
- Things are starting to click more than I thought they would at this point


## The Bad
- The class moves fast (6)
- Coding sux (Many of you i'm paraphrasing this)
- The career tasks on top of the labs on top of the scripting and additional reading/research plus studying is mind boggling!!
- Some of the instructions on the labs and ops challenges were a little unclear. This may have been intentional, but sometimes I would like clearer instructions.
- TA Assistance
- Using the Vet Tec program which requires a 90% (Clarification)
- I would say consider opening up the lab a little earlier if things need to be downloaded
- I also think the power hour, extra assignments or the more difficult assignments should be put on Thursday that way people get a more relaxing Friday and more time to study or relax.
- The least helpful is the Veeam account stuff i didnt think that was necessary.



## The UGLY
- power hours were not very helpful (2)


### Quote of the Week

- I like the class,  it is a bit overwhelming at times,  but your not pushing yourself if you are comfortable.
